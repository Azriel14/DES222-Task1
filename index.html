    <p id="pg1">HOW DO <span>YOU</span> DEFINE AND CHANGE YOUR RELATIONSHIPS TO PLACES? UNDERSTAND WHERE
      <span>YOU</span> ARE IN RELATION
      TO OTHER PLACES? HOW DO <span>YOU</span> UNDERSTAND THE PLACE <span>YOU</span> ARE IN? HOW DO <span>YOU</span>
      KNOW WHERE <span>YOU</span> ARE? SIGNAL WHERE <span>YOU</span>
      ARE?

    <p id="pg2">NEARLY ALL TECH HAS THE CAPACITY OF ADAPTING TO ITS ENVIRONMENT (AUTO-BRIGHTNESS SCREENS,
      MOTION SENSORS, ETC.), BUT BETTER YET, WHAT IF YOUR TECH'S UNDERSTANDING OF ITS SURROUNDINGS ALLOWED IT TO
      PROVIDE YOU A SYNTHETICALLY ENHANCED EXPERIENCE. WHETHER IT'S VR, AR, OR MAYBE EVEN MR, WE'VE ALREADY ACHIEVED
      FORMS OF ALLOWING WHERE YOU ARE RIGHT NOW TO BE WAY MORE THAN YOU THINK IT'S CRACKED UP TO BE. THIS IS MY
      UNDERSTANDING WHEN PROMPTED WITH <span>BEING IN PLACE: RELATIONSHIPS WITH SPACES</span> IN TERMS OF TECHNOLOGY.

    <p id="pg3">COMPANIES LIKE <span>HAVENXR</span>, FOUNDED IN 2019, IS ALREADY PIONEERING VR INTO
      ENTERTAINMENT BY
      TRANSPORTING USERS INTO CAPTIVATING VIRTUAL WORLDS. LEVERAGING CUTTING-EDGE VIRTUAL REALITY TECHNOLOGY WITH
      PHYSICAL SETS, <span>HAVENXR</span> OFFERS IMMERSIVE EXPERIENCES THAT REDEFINE ENTERTAINMENT BY BLENDING
      IMAGINATION,
      INNOVATION, AND INTERACTIVITY.</p>
    <img id="ph3" src="assets/Haven.jpg"></img>
    <p id="pg4">TECH GIANTS LIKE <span>APPLE</span> ARE PUSHING THE BOUNDARIES OF WHAT IS POSSIBLE IN TERMS OF
      SPATIAL
      COMPUTING, AUGMENTED REALITY (AR), AND LOCATION-BASED SERVICES.</p>
    <img id="ph4" src="assets/Apple.jpg"></img>
    <p id="pg5">THE <span>APPLE VISION PRO</span> IS A HIGH-END VIRTUAL REALITY (VR) AND AUGMENTED REALITY (AR)
      HEADSET THAT
      WAS ANNOUNCED BY APPLE IN JUNE 2023. IT FEATURES TWO ULTRA-HIGH-RESOLUTION DISPLAYS, A POWERFUL PROCESSOR, AND A
      VARIETY OF SENSORS THAT ALLOW FOR IMMERSIVE EXPERIENCES. THE <span>APPLE VISION PRO</span> IS A POWERFUL VR AND
      AR HEADSET
      THAT IS CAPABLE OF DELIVERING IMMERSIVE EXPERIENCES. IT IS STILL IN DEVELOPMENT, BUT IT HAS THE POTENTIAL TO
      REVOLUTIONIZE THE WAY WE INTERACT WITH TECHNOLOGY.</p>
    <img id="ph5" src="assets/Vision.jpg"></img>
    <p id="pg6">THIS TECHNOLOGY STILL HAS THE CAPACITY TO GROW IN THE FUTURE, POSSIBLY LEADING TO ONE
      RESEMBLING THAT FOUND IN THE 2016 SHORT FILM "<span>HYPER-REALITY</span>", DIRECTED BY KEIICHI MATSUDA. THE FILM
      EXPLORES A
      FUTURE WHERE AUGMENTED REALITY HAS BECOME AN INTEGRAL PART OF DAILY LIFE. THE PROTAGONIST WEARS AR GLASSES THAT
      OVERLAY DIGITAL INFORMATION AND VIRTUAL OBJECTS ONTO THE PHYSICAL WORLD. THROUGHOUT THE FILM, THE PROTAGONIST
      ENCOUNTERS A SERIES OF SURREAL AND CHAOTIC SCENES. DIGITAL ADVERTISEMENTS AND INFORMATION CONSTANTLY BOMBARD THE
      PROTAGONIST'S VISION, CREATING A SENSE OF INFORMATION OVERLOAD.

    <p id="pg7">THERE IS ALSO THE EVER-PRESENT CHANCE OF THE <span>METAVERSE</span> BEING WIDELY ADOPTED, WHICH
      COULD
      POTENTIALLY BRING ABOUT NOTABLE CHANGES IN HOW WE INTERACT WITH DIGITAL ENVIRONMENTS AND REDEFINE VARIOUS
      ASPECTS OF WORK, COMMUNICATION, AND LEISURE. META PROMISES THIS WOULD PROVIDE AN IMMERSIVE NATURE THAT OFFERS
      THE POSSIBILITY OF INFLUENCING A RANGE OF INDUSTRIES AND ACTIVITIES.</p>
